# Changelog

All notable changes to the `bitwarden-security-engineer` plugin will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.1.0] - 2026-09-08

### Changed

- Transitioned `triaging-security-findings`, `reviewing-dependencies`, `perform-security-review`, the agent, and the READMEs from Checkmarx One, SonarCloud, and Grype to Aikido
- Findings are queried via the `aikido:issues` skill instead of the GHAS code-scanning API
- `triaging-security-findings` documents the Jira-based Aikido triage flow, CVSS convention, group-scoped action verification, and ticket-scope pinning; its `gh api` examples pin the API version for stable `--jq` output
- `reviewing-dependencies` no longer groups `cloud_instance` under container images, and defers to `triaging-security-findings` for the CVSS convention
- `perform-security-review` step 1-C pre-fetches Aikido SAST/IaC/SCA/container findings; steps 2 and 4 reuse that evidence and are barred from re-fetching it via either `Skill(aikido:issues)` or the MCP tool. `tool-grants.md` documents the split
- Agent post-fix verification reports the Jira ticket update for an engineer to apply, rather than claiming to confirm it
- READMEs reflect Aikido; Usage blocks are labeled as example prompts, and `aikido` installs point at the `claude-plugins-official` marketplace

### Added

- README Prerequisites section for the separate `aikido` plugin and `/aikido:setup`
- Aikido MCP tool grant on the agent, so routed skills can reach the feed

### Removed

- Private Repository Notes section (SARIF billing and SonarCloud private-repo licensing no longer apply)
- Checkmarx state table and SonarCloud finding-management section

## [2.0.0] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- `--base-ref <ref>` parameter for `perform-security-review`, usable in non-interactive contexts
- `references/base-ref-resolution.md`, holding the rationale behind each base-ref gate
- `references/tool-grants.md`, explaining why no permission rule can safely grant `gh api`
- `Bash(git rev-parse:*)`, `Bash(git merge-base:*)`, and `Bash(printenv GITHUB_ACTIONS)` grants

### Fixed

- Branch comparison mode resolves the base ref instead of diffing against a hardcoded `main`
- Base-ref resolution keys on exit status, not output; `git rev-parse` prints the ref it could not resolve
- Every candidate passes a `git merge-base` gate, so a shallow clone cannot yield a zero-byte diff reviewed as clean
- Every candidate passes an `^[A-Za-z0-9_][A-Za-z0-9._/-]*$` allowlist before reaching a command; a legal ref name can still be a shell payload or a leading-dash option
- Step 1B checks exit status and content before launching agents, and clears the diff file's contents on every abort path
- Step 1B and the step 1-A2 abort both write their reason to the resolved output destination, since stopping skips step 6
- Step 5's branch comparison header reads `vs {base-ref}` instead of `vs main`

### Removed

- The `Bash(gh api --method GET *)` and `Bash(rm -f /tmp/security-review-*)` grants, with no replacement. Step 7 clears the temp diff with the granted `Write` tool instead, so cleanup still runs unattended. **Migration:** a deployment that needs GHAS evidence on the unattended path must add its own `gh api` allow rule and pair it with a read-only `GH_TOKEN`. Any `allowed-tools` wildcard absorbs an inserted `-X DELETE`, so no rule can constrain the verb — `references/tool-grants.md` shows the bypass. Step 1-C's three scan-evidence calls now prompt, and in CI they are denied and render as `Not checked (permission denied)` rather than `None`

### Changed

- Base-ref resolution moved into sub-step A2 as an ordered candidate list with one documented abort
- `allowed-tools` rewritten from space-separated to comma-separated and alphabetized, so the grants parse for the first time; `Task` added, since steps 2 and 4 launch agents; the unused `Bash(gh pr list:*)` grant removed
- The default-branch lookup uses `gh repo view` instead of `gh api`, so no grant can name an endpoint whose `DELETE` deletes the repository

## [1.4.0] - 2026-09-03

### Added

- `auditing-external-claude-plugins` skill: audits a third-party Claude Code plugin at a pinned commit before it's vendored, covering MCP config, dependency supply chain, tool permission scope, and prompt-injection surface. Runs as an isolated `fable` subagent and writes a report file rather than posting anywhere itself.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- `bitwarden-security-context`, `reviewing-security-architecture`, and `threat-modeling` skills now check alignment against Bitwarden's [Architecture Decision Records](https://contributing.bitwarden.com/architecture/adr/) as part of security assessments. Conflicts with an accepted ADR are treated as findings, significant undocumented architectural decisions are flagged as gaps, and ADR status is verified (not superseded/deprecated) before being cited.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-05-08

### Added

- `auditing-hackerone-vulns` skill: audits all open HackerOne-sourced VULN Jira tickets and their linked engineering child items to produce a prioritized action table. Correlates VULN status against child item progress and merged PRs, determines whether fixes are included in a shipped release (using tag-range commit search to handle cherry-pick workflows), and emits per-ticket action tokens (🔴 Update Status / 🟡 Mark Remediated / 🟢 Verify & Close / 🔵 Monitor / ⚪ Waiting / ➖ No Child Item) sorted by urgency.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-05-07

### Fixed

- Added `Skill` to the agent's `tools:` frontmatter so the agent can dispatch the six skills declared in its `skills:` block (`triaging-security-findings`, `threat-modeling`, `analyzing-code-security`, `reviewing-dependencies`, `detecting-secrets`, `reviewing-security-architecture`). Previously these declared skills could not be invoked.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-05-05

### Changed

- `threat-modeling` skill: revised based on AppSec review feedback on a real-world generated security definition document. Changes address noise, mis-scoped attacker assumptions, and missing rationale that surfaced when the skill was used to produce SDs for an unlock-flow feature.
  - Skill now requires every Security Goal to carry a **Rationale** (principle → asset → user-visible harm); goals without rationale are treated as claims, not requirements.
  - New guidance to prune **Dominated Threats** (SDs whose residual risk collapses to an already out-of-scope higher-privilege threat) and to add **Passive Observer** SDs wherever secrets cross into external services (LLM providers, log aggregators, analytics, training pipelines).
  - New rule to reality-check goals against runtime — "cleared from memory" / "zeroized" / "not retained" are flagged as unenforceable in GC'd, string-interned runtimes (JavaScript, .NET, JVM, Python).
  - New rule to prefer stdin or file-descriptor handoff over env/argv when a goal forbids secret exposure to `process.env` or `argv`.
  - New rule to verify "attacker does not have X" limitations against every supported OS (common pitfall: assuming kernel privileges are required for reading another process's environment).
  - Accepted Goal Status rationales of "brief" or "short-lived" now require a quantified **Exposure Window**.
  - Each SD must carry a **Criticality** tag (Critical / High / Medium / Low) and the document must be ordered by Criticality descending.

### Added

- `references/writing-quality-sds.md`: six named anti-patterns (dominated threat, adversarial-only attacker, unenforceable goal, aspirational limitation, shell-quoting SD, "brief exposure" trap), a prioritization heuristic, and a five-question self-consistency checklist.
- `references/bitwarden-vocabulary.md`: added **Passive Observer**, **Dominated Threat**, and **Exposure Window** to the standard terminology.
- `examples/security-definition-document.md`: template extended with **Criticality** field per SD, **Rationale** line per Security Goal, and a quantified-exposure-window reminder for accepted status.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-04-08

### Changed

- Simplified credential-storage and encryption-at-rest guidance in `reviewing-security-architecture` skill.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added

- Raising to version 1.0.0 because we are implementing a skill that leverages the skills and agents in the plugin to strengthen our security posture.
- `perform-security-review` skill: performs a multi-agent security code review with 4 specialized agents (code security, secrets & dependencies, security architecture, threat perspective), two-axis Severity × Confidence scoring, GitHub Advanced Security scan evidence gathering, and flexible output routing (chat, local file, or GitHub Actions workflow); supports `--output-dir <path>` for report placement
- `references/security-review-rubric.md`: OWASP Top 10 2025 checklist, severity × confidence threshold table, and Bitwarden-specific security invariants for agent grounding; includes security researcher framing in agent prompts and explicit P05 coverage for user-joined organization access paths

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-23

### Added

- `bitwarden-security-context` skill: lightweight quick-reference for security principles (P01-P06), vocabulary, and data classification standards
- Cross-plugin skill awareness: agent now invokes software engineer skills (`writing-server-code`, `writing-database-queries`, `writing-client-code`) to ground remediation recommendations in Bitwarden's actual conventions when the `bitwarden-software-engineer` plugin is installed alongside

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-12

### Added

- `bitwarden-security-engineer` agent for coordinating security engineering tasks
- `triaging-security-findings` skill for Checkmarx, SonarCloud, and Grype findings triage via GitHub Advanced Security API
- `threat-modeling` skill for STRIDE-based threat modeling with Bitwarden's engagement model and security definitions
- `analyzing-code-security` skill for code analysis against OWASP Top 10, API Top 10, Mobile Top 10, and CWE Top 25
- `reviewing-dependencies` skill for supply chain security, Dependabot triage, and dependency governance
- `detecting-secrets` skill for hardcoded credential detection, secret scanning, and remediation workflows
- `reviewing-security-architecture` skill for authentication, authorization, encryption, and trust boundary review
