# Bitwarden Security Engineer Plugin

Claude Code skills for application security at Bitwarden. Generic AI coding assistance doesn't know our scanner toolchain, triage workflows, or threat modeling practices. These skills keep Claude focused on how we secure software here.

## Overview

This plugin provides specialized skills for security engineering tasks — from triaging scanner findings and threat modeling to conducting multi-agent security code reviews. Skills can be invoked individually or orchestrated together for comprehensive coverage across code, dependencies, secrets, and architecture.

## Prerequisites

`triaging-security-findings`, `reviewing-dependencies`, and `perform-security-review` query the Aikido feed via the `aikido:issues` skill. That skill ships in the separate `aikido` plugin — Aikido Security's own Claude Code plugin — and requires an authenticated MCP session. Install it with `/plugin install aikido@claude-plugins-official` and run `/aikido:setup` before using those skills. For `triaging-security-findings` and `reviewing-dependencies`, Aikido is the primary data source: if it isn't installed, these skills stop and ask you to install it rather than silently returning no findings. `perform-security-review` treats Aikido SAST/IaC/SCA/container evidence as one of several best-effort corroborating sources rather than a hard requirement — if it's unavailable, the review continues using whichever sources it could reach.

## Usage

Install the plugin, then ask for what you want in natural language. Example prompts:

```
Use the bitwarden-security-engineer:bitwarden-security-engineer agent to triage the open Aikido findings on this PR.
```

```
Use the bitwarden-security-engineer:bitwarden-security-engineer agent to create a threat model for the new Send feature.
```

```
Use the bitwarden-security-engineer:bitwarden-security-engineer agent to review this code for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.
```

`auditing-external-claude-plugins` takes positional arguments instead:

```
/bitwarden-security-engineer:auditing-external-claude-plugins https://github.com/org/plugin <commit-sha>
```
