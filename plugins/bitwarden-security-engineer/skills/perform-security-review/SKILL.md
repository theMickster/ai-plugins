## Parameters

**`--base-ref <ref>`**: Branch comparison mode only. Use this ref as the diff base instead of probing for one. It still passes all three checks in step 1-A2, so an unresolvable or disconnected ref is rejected rather than trusted. Supply this when the probes in step 1-A2 would resolve the wrong base — a non-default trunk such as `rc`, or a repository where `gh` is unauthenticated so candidate 2 is unavailable. It does not rescue a default `actions/checkout`; `references/base-ref-resolution.md` says why and what does.

**`--output-dir <path>`**: When using `--output file`, write the report to `<path>/security-review-YYYY-MM-DD-{identifier}.md` instead of the current working directory. Tip: use `--output-dir ~/.claude/security-reviews/` to keep reports outside git repos.

## Security Review Mode

Determine review mode from the invocation. A PR number, commit SHA, or duration argument selects its own mode, and `--base-ref` selects branch comparison mode when no positional argument is given.

**If a positional argument and `--base-ref` are both present, stop and report the conflict**, naming both and asking for one. Launch no agents. Write the report to the resolved output destination, as the step 1-A2 abort does.

- **PR mode** (PR number or URL): `gh pr view <number>` for context, `gh pr diff <number>` for the diff.
- **Commit mode** (commit SHA): `git diff <sha>..HEAD` — reviews all changes after that commit.
- **Time-based mode** (duration, e.g., "last 48 hours"): find the oldest commit in range with `git log --since="<duration>" --reverse --format=%H | head -1`, then `git diff <sha>^..HEAD` to include it.
- **Local changes mode** (no PR, commit, or duration argument, no `--base-ref`, and pending changes exist): `git diff HEAD` for staged + unstaged changes.
- **Branch comparison mode** (no positional argument, and either `--base-ref <ref>` is given or the tree has no pending changes): `git diff <base-ref>...HEAD` — changes since the branch diverged from the base, resolved in sub-step A2 rather than assumed to be `main`. `--base-ref` selects this mode outright, so it works in a dirty tree, but a three-dot diff compares commits and leaves pending changes unreviewed. Run `git diff --quiet HEAD` here too and add the step 5 header's `Pending changes:` line when it reports dirty; without `--base-ref`, pending changes route to local changes mode instead.

Two of those modes turn on whether the tree is dirty. Test it with `git diff --quiet HEAD`, which exits 1 when pending changes exist.

## Security Review Process

**Model selection:** If `--model` is specified, use that model for all agents. Otherwise, default to `opus`.

Execute these steps in order. Do not skip, reorder, or combine them. Three places stop the run early, and taking them is following this rule: the mode-conflict stop above, the step 1-A2 abort, and the step 1B stops.

1. **Gather context.** Run all of these before launching any agents.

   **A.) Resolve repo identity.** Run each of these as its own Bash call — do NOT chain with `&&`, `||`, `;`, or pipes:
   - `git remote get-url origin` — parse `owner` and `repo` from the output. Handle both HTTPS (`https://github.com/owner/repo.git`) and SSH (`git@github.com:owner/repo.git`) formats.
   - `git branch --show-current` — capture the current branch name.

   **A2.) Resolve the base ref.** Branch comparison mode only; skip for every other mode. Run each command as its own Bash call. `references/base-ref-resolution.md` explains why each check below exists.

   A caller may supply `--base-ref <ref>`. When present it is the only candidate: do not probe for others, and if it fails any of the three checks below, go straight to the abort. Falling through to `origin/HEAD` would review a base the caller did not ask for. Use the ref exactly as given — never rewrite it — but a bare `main` resolves to the local branch rather than `origin/main`, so name the ref you used in the step 5 header, where a stale local base is at least visible.

   Otherwise, candidates in order:
   1. `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref origin/HEAD` — its output, when the command exits 0. Key on the exit status, never the output.
   2. `gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef --jq .defaultBranchRef.name`, giving `origin/<default_branch>`. Not `gh api`; see `references/tool-grants.md`. Build it whenever candidate 1 does not yield a base ref — either its command exited non-zero, so there is no candidate 1 at all, or its output failed one of the three checks. If the API call itself fails, candidate 2 does not exist.

   **Every candidate passes all three checks, in this order, whatever its source.** A probe candidate that fails any check is discarded and resolution falls through to the next probe. A caller-supplied `--base-ref` has no next candidate, so it goes straight to the abort.
   1. It matches `^[A-Za-z0-9_][A-Za-z0-9._/-]*$`, checked **before the value is placed in any command**. The reference file covers what that catches and why the leading character is pinned on its own.
   2. `git rev-parse --verify --quiet <candidate>` exits 0.
   3. `git merge-base <candidate> HEAD` exits 0.

   Keep the `origin/` prefix throughout. The first candidate to pass all three becomes `<base-ref>`.

   **The abort.** When no candidate passes, stop before step 1B; do not ask the user mid-run. Name which of the three checks the last candidate failed, since the remedies differ, then give all three ways out: `fetch-depth: 0` on the checkout, `git fetch origin <base>` before invoking, or PR mode with a pull request number. Write it to the resolved output destination, the same one a completed review would use. For `github` — `--output github`, or `--output` omitted and `printenv GITHUB_ACTIONS` exits 0 with non-empty output — that means `/tmp/review-summary.md` with `\n\n<!-- bitwarden-security-code-review -->` appended, which is what the workflow post-step reads; `file` and `chat` take the report path and the reply respectively. Do not run steps 1B through 7; no diff file exists to clean up.

   **B.) Fetch and save the diff.** Using the review mode determined above, run exactly one of these commands as a **single Bash call — no `&&`, `;`, or pipes. Shell redirection (`>`) is required and allowed**:
   - PR mode: `gh pr diff <number> > /tmp/security-review-<identifier>.diff`
   - Commit mode: `git diff <sha>..HEAD > /tmp/security-review-<identifier>.diff`
   - Time-based mode: `git diff <oldest-sha>^..HEAD > /tmp/security-review-<identifier>.diff`
   - Local changes mode: `git diff HEAD > /tmp/security-review-<identifier>.diff`
   - Branch comparison mode: `git diff <base-ref>...HEAD > /tmp/security-review-<identifier>.diff`

   `Read` the file **with a 1-line limit** on every path, including a non-zero exit — never unbounded, since the coordinator must not hold the diff. Read it even when the run has clearly failed: `Write` refuses to overwrite a file it has not read this session, so skipping the read leaves step 7 unable to clear a partially written diff. Then check the exit status and whether the file has content. Launch no agents unless the command exited 0 **and** the file has content.
   - Non-zero exit: the diff command failed. Report the failure and the exact diff command that was run.
   - Exit 0 with an empty file, branch comparison mode: a legitimate result. Report that there are no changes between `<base-ref>` and `HEAD`.
   - Exit 0 with an empty file, any other mode: report that the resolved range produced no diff, naming the mode and the range.

   In those three cases, and only those, clear the diff file with step 7's `Write` before stopping. On the success path it must survive: steps 2 and 4 hand its path to the agents.

   Report as the step 1-A2 abort does, to the resolved output destination. Stopping here skips step 5, so add the `Pending changes: not reviewed` note when the tree was dirty. Emit no summary table and no findings sections; nothing was reviewed.

   Choose a descriptive `<identifier>` (e.g., `PR123`, `5days`, `local`). Store the full path as `DIFF_FILE` and include it in every agent prompt in steps 2 and 4 so they can `Read` the diff directly.

   **C.) Fetch scan evidence.** None of these three calls stops the review if it fails — scan evidence corroborates findings in steps 2 and 4, it is not required for them to run. Aikido evidence uses the pre-approved MCP tool grant and runs without a prompt. The secret scanning and Dependabot `gh api` calls below are reads, and neither is pre-approved (`references/tool-grants.md` says why), so each prompts; in CI nobody answers and both are denied. Treat anything other than a successful response as a failure. Record each scanner's outcome as one of: its formatted output; `None` when it ran and returned nothing; `Not available` when the scanner is off or unreachable (403, 404, MCP server unavailable, GHAS not enabled) — and, for Aikido specifically, when the skill did not return a successful, authenticated response even if the result looks empty (a missing or unauthenticated session can surface as an empty result rather than a clear error); `Errored (<status>)` when the call ran and failed (malformed response); or, for the two `gh api` scanners only, `Not checked (permission denied)` when it never ran — Aikido's grant is pre-approved, so that state cannot occur for it. Only `None` means the scanner looked and found nothing; conflating it with `Not available` risks a missing Aikido session reading as a clean SAST/IaC scan. Use `gh api --jq` for all formatting — **DO NOT** pipe to `jq`. Both `gh api` calls **MUST** use `--method GET` and `-H "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2026-03-10"`.
   - **Aikido (SAST/IaC/SCA/Container):** Invoke `Skill(aikido:issues)` scoped to this repo (`repo_name={repo}`) with `issue_types: ["sast", "iac", "open_source", "docker_container"]` to list open findings. Bitwarden's SAST/IaC scanning runs through Aikido, not GitHub code scanning — do not query the `code-scanning/alerts` API, it will not have these findings. Format each returned issue as `SEVERITY | title | file (line N)`, and split the results into the two `SCAN_EVIDENCE` blocks below by issue type.
   - **Secret scanning:** `gh api --method GET -H "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2026-03-10" "repos/{owner}/{repo}/secret-scanning/alerts?state=open" --jq '.[] | "\(.secret_type_display_name) | \(.state) | \(.resolution // "open")"'`
   - **Dependabot:** `gh api --method GET -H "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2026-03-10" "repos/{owner}/{repo}/dependabot/alerts?state=open&per_page=100" --jq '.[] | "\(.security_advisory.severity | ascii_upcase) | \(.dependency.package.name) | \(.security_advisory.cve_id // .security_advisory.ghsa_id) | \(.security_advisory.summary)"'`

   Collect results into a `SCAN_EVIDENCE` block for use in steps 2 and 4:

   ```
   === SCAN EVIDENCE (pre-fetched — do not re-fetch) ===

   --- AIKIDO (SAST/IAC) ---
   {one of: formatted output | None | Not available | Errored (<status>)}

   --- AIKIDO (SCA/CONTAINER) ---
   {one of: formatted output | None | Not available | Errored (<status>)}

   --- SECRET SCANNING ---
   {one of: formatted output | None | Not available | Errored (<status>) | Not checked (permission denied)}

   --- DEPENDABOT ---
   {one of: formatted output | None | Not available | Errored (<status>) | Not checked (permission denied)}
   ```

2. Launch these four (4) `subagent_type: "bitwarden-security-engineer:bitwarden-security-engineer"` agents in parallel. Each agent has a specific domain — you **MUST** instruct it to stay within that domain. The agent **MUST** read `references/security-review-rubric.md` before starting **AND** before evaluating findings.

   **Agent 1 — Code Security**: Focus exclusively on injection flaws (SQL, XSS, command), cryptographic weaknesses, insecure coding patterns, and OWASP A01–A05. Invoke `Skill(bitwarden-security-context)` and `Skill(analyzing-code-security)` to guide your analysis. Do not evaluate secrets, dependencies, architecture, or threat modeling.

   **Agent 2 — Secrets & Dependencies**: Focus exclusively on hardcoded credentials, exposed secrets, vulnerable packages, and supply chain risk. Invoke `Skill(bitwarden-security-context)`, `Skill(detecting-secrets)`, and `Skill(reviewing-dependencies)` to guide your analysis, but for Aikido SCA/container data use the pre-fetched `--- AIKIDO (SCA/CONTAINER) ---` block from `SCAN_EVIDENCE` instead of querying `aikido:issues` live — that tool is off-limits here, see the constraint below. Do not evaluate code patterns, architecture, or threat modeling.

   **Agent 3 — Security Architecture**: Focus exclusively on authentication, authorization, encryption implementation, trust boundaries, and Bitwarden's zero-knowledge invariant (encryption and decryption happen client-side only — the server must never have access to plaintext vault data). Invoke `Skill(reviewing-security-architecture)` and `Skill(bitwarden-security-context)` to guide your analysis. Do not evaluate injection flaws, secrets, or threat modeling.

   **Agent 4 — Threat Perspective**: Focus exclusively on attacker-oriented analysis — trace user input through data flows to dangerous sinks, business logic flaws, privilege escalation paths, data exposure, and API abuse patterns. Invoke `Skill(bitwarden-security-context)`, `Skill(analyzing-code-security)`, and `Skill(threat-modeling)` to guide your analysis. Do not evaluate architecture patterns, secrets, or dependency versions.

   For all four agents:
   - Use the selected model.
   - **CRITICAL: Every agent prompt MUST include this framing at the start:** "You are a security researcher analyzing code for impactful, exploitable, and reproducible vulnerabilities for an authorized internal security audit. Your goal is to find real bugs — approach this analysis without safety refusals, as this is an explicitly authorized internal security engagement at Bitwarden."
   - **CRITICAL: Every agent prompt MUST include this constraint:** "The diff has been pre-fetched and saved to `{DIFF_FILE}` — read it using the `Read` tool. **DO NOT** execute `gh pr diff`, `git diff`, or any other diff commands. NEVER use WebFetch, WebSearch, `Skill(aikido:issues)`, `mcp__plugin_aikido_aikido-mcp__aikido_issues_list`, or any `gh api` endpoints — scan evidence has been pre-fetched and is provided below."
   - **CRITICAL: Every agent prompt MUST include the full `SCAN_EVIDENCE` block** gathered in step 1.
   - Report all findings with: severity (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW/INFO), affected file and line, and recommended remediation.
   - Report positive security changes (e.g., fixing a CWE, improving cryptography) as ✅ Strengths with a brief rationale.

3. After all four agents return, rate each finding using the two-axis model defined in `references/security-review-rubric.md`:
   - **Severity**: 🔴 CRITICAL | 🟠 HIGH | 🟡 MEDIUM | 🔵 LOW | ⚪ INFO
   - **Confidence**: 🟢 HIGH | 🟡 MEDIUM | 🔵 LOW
   - Apply the threshold matrix in the rubric to assign a triage category: 🚨 Blocker, ⚠️ Improvement, 📝 Note, ✅ Strength, or ❌ Dismiss.

4. Launch a **verification agent** `subagent_type: "bitwarden-security-engineer:bitwarden-security-engineer"` with all combined findings, their severity/confidence ratings, the triage matrix, the `DIFF_FILE` path, and the full `SCAN_EVIDENCE` block from step 1.
   - **CRITICAL: Every agent prompt MUST include this constraint:** "The diff has been pre-fetched and saved to `{DIFF_FILE}` — read it using the `Read` tool. Do NOT run `gh pr diff`, `git diff`, or any other diff commands. NEVER use WebFetch, WebSearch, `Skill(aikido:issues)`, `mcp__plugin_aikido_aikido-mcp__aikido_issues_list`, or any `gh api` endpoints — scan evidence has been pre-fetched and is provided above."
   - The verification agent **MUST review**, **evaluate**, **verify**, and **confirm** all findings and ratings.
   - Use scan evidence to triangulate: findings corroborated by scanner alerts → increase confidence; findings in areas scanners cleared → apply additional scrutiny.
   - The verification agent **MUST** classify each finding as: 🚨 Blocker, ⚠️ Improvement, 📝 Note, ✅ Strength, or ❌ Dismiss — applying the threshold matrix from step 2.
   - The verification agent **MUST** provide a brief rationale for each finding's classification.
   - The verification agent **MUST NOT** remove any findings.
   - The verification agent **MUST NOT** introduce any new findings.

5. Format the summary report.

   First, set the report header based on review mode:
   - **PR mode**: `PR: (#{number}) - {PR title} — {YYYY-MM-DD}`
   - **Commit mode**: `Code Review: {short SHA}..HEAD — {YYYY-MM-DD}`
   - **Time-based mode**: `Code Review: Changes since {duration} — {YYYY-MM-DD}`
   - **Local changes mode**: `Code Review: Local Changes — {YYYY-MM-DD}`
   - **Branch comparison mode**: `Code Review: {branch} vs {base-ref} — {YYYY-MM-DD}`, followed by a `Pending changes: not reviewed` line when the tree was dirty and omitted when it was not.

   Then format the report:

   ```markdown
   # 🤖 Claude Security Code Review 🤖

   {header}

   **Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD}

   <details>
   <summary><strong>Commits reviewed:</strong> {short-sha}..HEAD · {n} commits · {path1}, {path2}</summary>

   | SHA     | Title          |
   | ------- | -------------- |
   | `{sha}` | {commit title} |

   </details>

   ## Summary

   | Category        | Count |
   | --------------- | ----- |
   | 🚨 Blockers     | {n}   |
   | ⚠️ Improvements | {n}   |
   | 📝 Notes        | {n}   |
   | ✅ Strengths    | {n}   |
   | ❌ Dismissed    | {n}   |

   {Up to 6 bullets. Include: overall security posture, zero-knowledge invariant status, notable positive changes, key risks or patterns worth watching, and any context that affects how findings should be interpreted. Each bullet should be one tight sentence.}

   ## 🚨 Blockers

   {Each finding: "- [Description]\n - Location: `filename.ts:42`\n - Severity: 🔴 CRITICAL | 🟠 HIGH\n - Confidence: 🟢 HIGH | 🟡 MEDIUM\n - Rationale: [Why classified as Blocker]"}

   ## ⚠️ Improvements

   {Each finding: "- [Description]\n - Location: `filename.ts:42`\n - Severity: 🔴 CRITICAL | 🟠 HIGH | 🟡 MEDIUM\n - Confidence: 🟢 HIGH | 🟡 MEDIUM\n - Rationale: [Why classified as Improvement]"}

   ## 📝 Notes

   {Each finding: "- [Description]\n - Location: `filename.ts:42`\n - Severity: 🟡 MEDIUM | 🔵 LOW | ⚪ INFO\n - Confidence: 🟢 HIGH | 🟡 MEDIUM\n - Rationale: [Why classified as Note]"}

   ## ✅ Strengths

   <details>
   <summary>Expand for details on ({n}) strengths</summary>

   {Each strength: "- [Description]\n - Location: `filename.ts:42`\n - Rationale: [Why this is a positive security change]"}

   </details>

   ## ❌ Dismissed

   <details>
   <summary>Expand for details on ({n}) dismissed findings</summary>

   {Each finding: "- [Description]\n - Location: `filename.ts:42`\n - Severity: 🔴 CRITICAL | 🟠 HIGH | 🟡 MEDIUM | 🔵 LOW | ⚪ INFO\n - Confidence: 🔵 LOW\n - Rationale: [Why dismissed]"}

   </details>
   ```

   Omit any section with zero findings entirely — do not render an empty heading. For `<details>` sections, omit them entirely if the count is zero.

6. Check the `--output` argument to determine the output destination. If `--output` is omitted, run `printenv GITHUB_ACTIONS` as its own Bash call and check whether it exits 0 with non-empty output — if set, default to `github`; otherwise default to `chat`.

   ### Output: `chat`

   Default when `--output` is omitted and not running in CI.
   1. Return the report directly to the user in the chat.
   2. Do **NOT** write any files.

   ### Output: `file`
   1. If `--output-dir <path>` is specified, write to `<path>/security-review-YYYY-MM-DD-{identifier}.md`. Otherwise write to the current working directory.
   2. `{identifier}` is the PR number (e.g., `PR123`), commit SHA (short), or `local`.
   3. Do **NOT** use `gh pr comment`, `gh api`, or any MCP posting tool.
   4. Confirm the file path to the user after writing.

   ### Output: `github`

   Default when `--output` is omitted and `printenv GITHUB_ACTIONS` exits 0 with non-empty output, as step 6 resolves it.
   1. Write the report to `/tmp/review-summary.md` using the **Write** tool.
   2. Append `\n\n<!-- bitwarden-security-code-review -->` at the end of the file content.
   3. Do **NOT** use `gh pr comment`, `gh api`, or any MCP posting tool.
   4. Confirm to the user: "Report written to `/tmp/review-summary.md` for workflow pickup."

   The workflow post-step will read this file and update the placeholder comment automatically.

7. Clear the temporary diff file. If step 1B created `DIFF_FILE`, use the **Write tool** to overwrite it with an empty string, in every output mode and whether or not findings were reported. The file remains, empty. A run that aborted in step 1-A2 never created one. Do not report this step.
