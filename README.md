## Usage

### Adding this marketplace to Claude Code

```bash
# Short form (GitHub owner/repo)
/plugin marketplace add bitwarden/ai-plugins

# Full GitHub URL
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/bitwarden/ai-plugins
```

After adding the marketplace, restart Claude Code for the changes to take effect.

You can also use `/plugin` interactively to manage marketplaces and plugins through a guided interface.

### Installing plugins

Once the marketplace is added, install plugins using:

```bash
/plugin install plugin-name@bitwarden-marketplace
```

Plugins are installed to `~/.claude/plugins/` by default. Restart Claude Code after installing for the plugin to become active.

### Keeping plugins up to date

Third-party marketplaces don't auto-update by default. To enable automatic updates, open `/plugin`, go to **Marketplaces**, select this marketplace, and choose **Enable auto-update**. Claude Code will then refresh marketplace data and update installed plugins at startup.

You can also update manually at any time:

```bash
/plugin marketplace update bitwarden-marketplace
```
